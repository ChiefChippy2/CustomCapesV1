# CustomCapesV1 - Get any cape for free

# What is CustomCapesV1?
CustomCapes is a program that allows the user to use any cape (requires optifine for it to work).

# Why should i use CustomCapesv1?
CustomCapesv1 is easy to use, it allows you to get your favourite capes for free.It works on any client Lunar,Badlion,Feather Client etc



# What are the drawbacks?
Client side only this means only you an see it.
Script has to run until you join a world.

# How does it work?
When optifine sends a request to their cape server, the script changes that redirect to the local computer and returns the cape you like that you have selected.

# Why does this require admin rights?
This is because the script modifies a file that needs admin rights to open which is where it redirects optifine to your local pc. To run this as an admin right click the exe and click "run as administrator".

# When should i not use CustomCapes?
1. If you have forge or fabric as there will be mods allowing you to customize your cape that are 10x better than this.
2. If you use dont use optifine minecraft , this program only works if you use optifine.
