Very ugly and boring GUI 
You wanna enter ur Minecraft ign/name in the entry box then click choose open cape file so what u wanna do here is redirect yourself to the capes folder where all the capes are then click on the cape u want (If you wanna use your own just add it to the capes folder!) Then click start and restart minecraft if there is a problem please report it to me iTrojang#7855

# Thank
